              <p>Temporary accommodation for major events can be found through pop-up hostel networks that deploy near venues during large festivals, sporting events, conferences, and cultural gatherings. Cities like Munich (Oktoberfest), Rio de Janeiro (Carnival), Melbourne (Australian Open), and Austin (SXSW) regularly feature pop-up sleep villages, container hotels, and modular pod accommodations within walking distance of event venues.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Pop-up hostels operate under varying legal frameworks depending on the city and country. In many jurisdictions, they require temporary lodging permits, fire safety certificates, sanitation compliance, and insurance. Reputable pop-up hostel operators work with local authorities to obtain all necessary permits. MobileHostel only lists Tier A (verified operators with permits) and Tier B (city-approved or partner-backed) accommodations. Always check for visible permits, fire exits, security personnel, proper sanitation facilities, and verified reviews before booking.</p>

            </summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>When hotels sell out during major events, the best alternatives include pop-up hostels and sleep villages near venues, container hotels and modular pod accommodations, converted warehouses and repurposed buildings, glamping setups in parks and open spaces, university dormitory rentals during holiday periods, and house-sharing through verified platforms. Pop-up accommodations are specifically designed for event overflow situations and are often closer to venues than traditional hotels.</p>

Notable examples include container hotels in Amsterdam's NDSM Wharf, modular pods at Swiss Alpine events, and stacked container villages used during FIFA World Cup host cities.

These include temporary sleep villages within walking distance, shuttle-connected container hostels in nearby lots, glamping setups in parks or fields near the venue, and converted spaces like gyms or community centers offering cot-based accommodation.
