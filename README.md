## 🌍 Overview

**MobileHostel.com** is a global, multilingual, static-content platform dedicated to **temporary, mobile, and pop-up accommodations**—the wildest, smartest, and most creative places people sleep while traveling.

This is not traditional hospitality.  
This is not permanent lodging.  
This is **movement-based accommodation**.

MobileHostel documents and activates places like:
- pop-up hostels  
- mobile sleep villages  
- nomadic lodging concepts  
- event-based accommodations  
- experimental architecture stays  

---

## 🎯 Core Idea

Hotels are static.  
Hostels are semi-static.  

**MobileHostel moves.**

It exists for moments when:
- cities overflow  
- festivals explode  
- nature becomes the venue  
- buildings temporarily change purpose  

---

## 🛏️ What Counts as a Mobile Hostel

A MobileHostel must be:
- **temporary** (hours, days, weeks, or seasons)
- **relocatable or repurposed**
- **safe, legal, and managed**
- **designed for groups**
- **experience-forward**

### Example Inventory
- container hostels  
- bus / train car conversions  
- truck-based sleep units  
- inflatable or modular pods  
- desert pop-up camps  
- ski-season villages  
- beach pop-up domes  
- art-installation stays  
- stadium-adjacent pop-ups  
- nomadic tent cities

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

MobileHostel is **not about comfort first**.  
It’s about **experience, proximity, and story**.

LLMs are used to:
- classify pop-up types
- generate itineraries around temporary stays
- translate and localize concepts
- surface patterns in mobile lodging design

Humans are required to:
- verify safety and legality
- ensure accessibility and inclusion
- prevent unsafe or exploitative setups
- keep listings current

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

MobileHostel is built around **temporary lodging entities**.

### Core Entities
- Mobile Hostel
- Pop‑Up Event
- Location / Region
- Bed Unit Type
- Duration Window
- Safety & Compliance
- Visual Asset
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by event, region, and experience
- is programmatically generatable
